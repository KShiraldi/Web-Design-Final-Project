				<p>History – The original  concept for the brewery began in 1995, but it wasn't until December of 1997  that the brewing system was purchased. It was discovered by chance after  investigating another system in Texas  that looked great on paper, but wasn't adequate for the needs of the brewery.  After passing on that system Dan had some time to kill and decided to travel  around. During a visit to a brewpub in Austin,   TX he discovered what would  become our brewing system. He went in and asked them what kind of beers they  made. They told him that they had stopped making beer and were actually  preparing to sell their system. After checking it out the purchase was made and  a month later the system was shipped up to Ithaca.</p>
				<p>Five months of renovation took place at our 606 Elmira Rd. location to turn it in to a functional brewery. After all the hard work renovating and setting up the equipment we were ready to begin the actual process of creating beer! The operation started small with only a couple of people (Dan and our previous Brew Master Jeff Conuel) doing everything that needed to be done to get the business off the ground. From the making of the beer, the packaging, the selling, and the mountains of paperwork necessary to operate a brewery they did it all. In December of ’98 the brewery officially opened.</p>
