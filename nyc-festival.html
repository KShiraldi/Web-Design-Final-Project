				<h1>What is the NYC Craft Beer Festival?</h1>
				<p>The NYC Craft Beer Festival is an American craft beer tasting event focusing on craft  brews with approximately 75 breweries and 150 American craft beers. The 2012 event was held March 3, at the Lexington Armory. </p>
				<p>In the tradition of the Grand Tasting, each attendee will be given a tasting glass and have the opportunity to try unlimited 2 oz tastings of approximately 150 craft beers from all over the country.  Food will be available for purchase for all attendees and there will be a selection of retail vendors on-site.  VIP and Connoisseur attendees will have the first hour to themselves to sample these great brews and Connoisseurs will have a private lounge with rare selections and passed hors d'oeuvres throughout the session.  We will also be offering expert seminars for all attendees (first-come first-served) that highlight key aspects of the craft beer industry including pairings, business, and more!</p>
