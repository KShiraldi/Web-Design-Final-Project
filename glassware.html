				<h1>Beer Glassware</h1>
				<p>As soon as the beer hits the glass, its color, aroma and taste is altered, your eye candy receptors tune in, and your anticipation is tweaked. Hidden nuances, become more pronounced, colors shimmer, and the enjoyment of the beer simply becomes a better, more complete, experience. So which glassware do you use?</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Flute<img src="pictures/flute_glass.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Flute Glass" /></th>
						<td>
							<p>The world of  champagne lends elegance to certain types of beer. Long and narrow bodies  ensure that carbonation doesn't dissipate too quickly and showcase a lively  carbonation or sparkling color. Stems will often be a bit shorter than the  traditional champagne glass, but not necessarily. </p>
							<p>Benefits:  Enhances and showcases carbonation. Releases volatiles quickly for a more  intense upfront aroma.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Chalice<img src="pictures/goblet_glass.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Chalice Glass" /></th>
						<td>
							<p>Majestic pieces  of work, ranging from delicate and long stemmed (Goblet) to heavy and thick  walled (Chalice). The more delicate ones may also have their rims laced with  silver or gold, while the heavy boast sculpture-like stems. Some are designed  to maintain a 2-centimeter head. This is achieved by scoring the inside bottom  of the glass, which creates a CO2 nucleation point, and a stream of eternal bubbles  and perfect head retention as a result. </p>
							<p>Benefits: Eye  candy. Designed to maintain head. Wide-mouthed for deep sips.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Pint<img src="pictures/pint_glass.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Pint Glass" /></th>
						<td>
							<p>Near  cylindrical, with a slight taper and wide-mouth. There are two standard sizes,  the 16-ounce (US Tumbler - the pour man's pint glass and most common) or the  20-ounce Imperial (Nonic), which has a slight ridge towards the top, a grip of  sorts and helps in stacking them. The 20-ounce version is preferred to  accommodate more beer or beers with large crowning heads. A Becker is the  German equivalent, tapering at the top. </p>
							<p>Benefits: Cheap  to make. Easy to store. Easy to drink out of. </p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Snifter<img src="pictures/snifter_glass.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Snifter Glass" /></th>
						<td>
							<p>Used for brandy  and cognac, these wide-bowled and stemmed glasses with their tapered mouths are  perfect for capturing the aromas of strong ales. Volumes range, but they all  provide room to swirl and agitate volatiles. <br />
							</p>
							<p>Benefits:  Captures and enhances volatiles. </p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Tulip<img src="pictures/tulip_glass.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Tulip Glass" /></th>
						<td>
							<p>A stemmed glass,  obviously tulip-shaped, wherein the top of the glass pushes out a bit to form a  lip in order to capture the head and the body is bulbous. Scotch Ales are often  served in a thistle glass which is a modified tulip glass that  resembles Scotland's  national flower.</p>
							<p> Benefits:  Captures and enhances volatiles, while it induces and supports large foamy  heads.</p>
